A thief decides to rob a jewellery store. He carries a gunny bag along with him that can only carry 'x' kgs of weight. When he enters the store, there are articles of various materials of different values and weights. Given a list of items and the cost of associated with these items and their respective weights, determine the items that the theif should prefer carrying along in a descending order of precedence such that they could help him make maximum profit.

Constraints:
1. Adding fractions of an item is not allowed
2. Output must be in the same order as that of object insertion to the bag.
3. Object names are unique
4. An object can have negative cost, but it cannot have negative weight or a negative quantity.

Note : Print -1 in case any of the constraints are not satisfied.

Example:
Consider Bag capacity = 22 kgs

Object     Available Qty.   Weight of each unit in kgs       Cost
  A          3               3            75
  B        6               1            35
  C        7                           2                        10
  D          6               4            80

Solution: -
Sort the input in descending order of cost/weight     
Object     Available Qty.   Weight of each unit in kgs       Cost
  B        6              1             35
  A           3              3             75
  D         6             4             80
  C        7                          2                          10

Add the objects to the bag in the order of cost by weight that would provide maximum benefit
6*B+3*A+1*D+1*C

Sample Input:-
22

A 3 3 75
B 6 1 35
C 7 2 10
D 6 4 80
