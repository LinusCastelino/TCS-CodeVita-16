Rule: Consider an 'x' digit number. List all the possible numbers in such a way that, the digit at a particular position must indicate the number-of-times its position value is repeated in the resulting number. 

Note: If no output exists for the given input, print -1

Example:-

Consider x=4

Answer :     1   2   1   0

             --  --  --  --

Position :   0   1   2    3  

The number 1210 indicates that the number 0 (position 0) is repeated 1 time in the answer, the number 1 (position 1) is repeated 2 times in the answer, the number 2 (position 2) is repeated 1 time in the answer and the number 3 (position 3) is repeated 0 times in the answer.

Another answer for x=4 will be 2020, which satisfies the rule.


Sample Input:
4

Sample Output:
1210
2020
