Input:
60|1|92|823|104|5|76|7|58|439||012699    (Encrypted password)
*Acf$Zd\T@    (Input characters; It is a rule that the password will only contain these characters)

Output :
@Z@$Z$$d*f    (Password)

Explanatory example:-

Steps used to encrypt the password:

1. Consider input characters and its position 
		Input character list 		:	* A c f $ Z d \ T @
		Position			:	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
(Note: The character list will not contain more than 10 characters and each character must be unique)

2. Now replace the characters in the password with the position value of the respective character as defined in step 1, to convert the password into a numeric value.
		Password 			:	@ Z @ $ Z $ $ d * f
		Numeric value			:	9 5 9 4 5 4 4 6 0 3
(Note : Remember left most value (Say A) = 9)

3. Starting from the left most postion, add each digit to the digit on its right. Add the last digit with the first digit in the sequence
		Numeric value of password	:	9    5    9    4    5    4    4    6    0    3
		Addition 			:	  14   14    13   9    9    8    10   6    3    12

4. For each addition result equal to or greater than 10, subtract it by 10 and note its position.
		Additive step output		:	14   14    13   9    9    8    10   6    3    12
		Selective subtraction		:	4    4     3    9    9    8    0    6    3    2
		Selective subtraction position	:	0    1     2                   6              9
(Note: Remember the selective subtraction step positions obtained (Say B) = 01269)

5. The password will follow the following format
		Format				:	0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9

6. Now, each number in this format is pre-appended with the positions of the occurrence of the respective number in the output obtained in selective subtraction step of Step 4.
		Coded password			:	60|1|92|823|104|5|76|7|58|439
(Note: Say C = 60|1|92|823|104|5|76|7|58|439)

7. The final encrypted password will be of the following format to account for the calculations performed in generating the encrypted password
		Encrypted password (format)	:	<C>||<B><A>
		Encrypted password		:	60|1|92|823|104|5|76|7|58|439||012699

The above explanation is about how the encrypted password is obtained using the password and character list. The question that I submitted in CodeVita asks to revert this algorithm. The input will contain the encrypted password and the character list, and the expected output would be the password itself.
