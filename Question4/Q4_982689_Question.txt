Question Name:
Calculate the longest possible route

Question Text:
Given an MxN matrix, with a few hurdles arbitrarily placed, calculate the cost of longest possible route from point A to point B within the matrix.

Note: 

1.The cost from one position to another will be 1 unit. 

2. A location once visited in a particular path cannot be visited again.

3. A route will only consider adjacent hops. The route cannot consist of diagonal hops.

4. The position with a hurdle cannot be visited.

5. The values MxN signifies that the matrix consists of rows ranging from 0 to M-1 and and columns ranging from 0 to N-1.

6. If the dest is not reachable or src/dest overlap with hurdles, print cost as -1.

Example:

Consider a 3x4 martix with a hurdle at (2,2). Consider A(2,3) and B(0,1)

Input:

3 4

1                        --(no. of hurdles ) 

2 2

2 3                     -- (position of A)

0 1                      -- (postion of B)



Output :

10
